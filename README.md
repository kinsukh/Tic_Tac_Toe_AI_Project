# Tic_Tac_Toe_AI_Project
Tic-Tac-Toe is a great way to pass your free time whether you're standing in a queue or spending time with your friends or kids.

This is a bot which created to play tic-tac-toe with humans on the basis of AI based Algorithms. Containing two pyhton files Player_module.py and Game_module.py 
I have used Minimax Algorithm here in the code , which is basically based on the concept of Artificial Intelligence , The algorithm makes the computer to play the
game as more natural as humans .
